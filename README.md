Zen (Python):
In the words of Tim Peters, "The Zen of Python" is a collection of guiding principles for writing computer programs in Python. These principles include:
- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Readability counts.
- ...

To follow these principles and improve the quality of your Python code, it is recommended to install pycodestyle, a tool to check your Python code against the style guide defined in PEP 8. 

Installation:
To install Python3, pip3, and pycodestyle, follow the instructions for your specific operating system.
