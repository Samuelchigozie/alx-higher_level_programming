# Readme file for Tasks

This repository contains solutions to the programming tasks mentioned below. These tasks are aimed at enhancing the programming skills of the user and testing their knowledge of Python and C programming.

## Task 1: Run Python file

Write a shell script that runs a Python script. The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable `$PYFILE`.

Usage: `./task1.sh`

## Task 2: Run inline

Write a shell script that runs Python code. The Python code will be saved in the environment variable `$PYCODE`.

Usage: `./task2.sh`

## Task 3: Hello, print

Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle", followed by a new line.

Usage: `python3 task3.py`

## Task 4: Print integer

Complete the source code in order to print the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by "Battery street", followed by a new line.

Usage: `python3 task4.py`

## Task 5: Print float

Complete the source code in order to print the float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits.

Usage: `python3 task5.py`

## Task 6: Print string

Complete the source code in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable `str`, followed by its first 9 characters.

Usage: `python3 task6.py`

## Task 7: Play with strings

Complete this source code to print "Welcome to Holberton School!"

Usage: `python3 task7.py`

## Task 8: Copy - Cut - Paste

Complete this source code.

Usage: `python3 task8.py`

## Task 9: Create a new sentence

Complete this source code to print "object-oriented programming with Python", followed by a new line.

Usage: `python3 task9.py`

## Task 10: Linked list cycle

Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

Prototype: `int check_cycle(listint_t *list);`

Return: `0` if there is no cycle, `1` if there is a cycle

Requirements:

- Only these functions are allowed: `write`, `printf`, `putchar`, `puts`, `malloc`, `free`
- Compile the code this way: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 10-main.c 10-check_cycle.c 10-linked_lists.c -o cycle`
